# TierTracker (Python 3.8.1)

very similar to op.gg-tracker (https://github.com/Piggey/op.gg-tracker) but using Riot Games' Official API

>pip install APScheduler

>pip install riotwatcher

when setting up, creates cfg.json file that holds all of the variables needed (such as API key, Summoner name and such) so that you dont need to type it all again everytime you launch it.

(if you want to change something please just delete the existing file)
